###What is Bridges Career Academies and Workplace Connection?
Bridges is a non-profit that "bridges the gap" between highschools, colleges, their students and the businesses in the Brainerd Lakes Area. The main goal is to educate and inform the students on career opportunities that are available in the community, as well as, across the country. High school students are spending outrageous amounts of money going on a whim in hopes that the career they've heard about is the right one for them.

###Okay, so what is "Career Exploration Day"?
Career Exploration Day is their capstone even that happens once a year in March. 2500 students from across the Brainerd Lakes Area converge onto the Central Lakes College campus in Brainerd, MN for a 1-day event of career exploration. The students are free once at the college to learn and explore on their own.

This may sound like a career "fair" where businesses pile in behind tables or booths and hand out flyers to get employees, but it's waaaaay different. The day is filled with tons of literal hands-on experiences in each "Cluster".

A "Cluster" is what each business is broken down into (which are color coordinated. The 7 Clusters are:
- Orange - Construction & Trades, Marine & Small Engines, Automotive & Heavy Equipment, Welding, Manufacturing, Engineering & Aviation
- Blue - Public Safety
- Yellow - Hospitality & Recreation, Business & Finance
- Green - Agriculture, Food & Natural Resources
- Purple - Communication, Art & Design, Computers & IT
- Black - Liberal Arts
- Red - Health Sciences
